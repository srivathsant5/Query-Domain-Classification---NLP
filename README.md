# Query-Domain-Classification---NLP
Build a system to categorize the query on the basis of the domain using Natural Language Processing.



## Problem Statement

DSForum is a community-based portal where users can post queries related to data science topics such as machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization, etc. The company optimizes the response time of the query by answering the query to the earliest. Nevertheless, the community can answer the queries through discussion forums. The queries might be related to different domains like Techniques, Tools, Careers, etc. 


Currently, the users manually tag the queries while posting the query into any of these categories: Techniques, Tools, Career, Hackathons, Resources, Misc, or Other. The query is then forwarded to the concerned team. This process is more error-prone and impacts the query response time.
